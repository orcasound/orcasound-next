# Changes to persist the Codex auth/config directory across container restarts:
# 1. Added named volume mount: codex-home:/root/.codex
# 2. Added top-level named volume declaration.


# What “persist the auth/config directory” means:

# Normally, when you rebuild, the container filesystem is recreated.
# Files under /root/.codex (tokens, settings, cached auth/session data) are lost unless mounted.
# By mounting a named Docker volume to /root/.codex, that directory survives container rebuilds.
# So next rebuild can reuse prior Codex config/login state from that volume.
# Important caveat: This persists local credentials/config files, but if your account token/session is expired/revoked server-side, re-login can still be required.
